## üöÄ **Current Development Priorities**

### **Priority 1: MCP Integration & AI Development Experience - COMPLETED ‚úÖ**
- [x] Set up basic MCP integration (2-server setup: docs + rules)
- [x] Install MCP filesystem server package
- [x] Create cursor/config.json configuration
- [x] Test MCP integration in Cursor AI
- [x] Verify AI agents can access project documentation

### **Priority 2: Enhanced GraphQL Implementation**
- [ ] Implement hybrid GraphQL architecture (Supabase + Apollo)
- [ ] Migrate simple CRUD operations to Supabase GraphQL
- [ ] Keep complex business logic in custom Apollo Server
- [ ] Implement React Query hooks for data fetching
- [ ] Optimize database queries and eliminate N+1 issues

### **Priority 3: Business Features Development**
- [ ] Complete property management system
- [ ] Implement tour reservation flow with 10% deposit
- [ ] Build agency dashboard for property management
- [ ] Create admin console for financial tracking
- [ ] Implement Stripe payment integration

---

## üéØ **Simplified AI Integration Approach**

### **What We Need (Practical Value):**
1. **Better AI Context** - Enhanced documentation access for AI assistants
2. **MCP Integration** - Simple 2-server setup for immediate value
3. **Practical Patterns** - Focus on real development patterns, not enterprise complexity
4. **Quality Code Generation** - Better component and hook generation
5. **Workflow Automation** - Basic MCP integration for development tasks

### **What We Don't Need (Overkill):**
- ‚ùå Complex MCP server architecture (6+ servers)
- ‚ùå Database server integration (existing GraphQL hooks work fine)
- ‚ùå Audit logging and compliance systems
- ‚ùå Enterprise-level security layers
- ‚ùå Overly complex GitHub automation workflows

### **Enhanced Implementation:**
```json
// cursor/config.json (enhanced setup)
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "avent-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./docs"]
    },
    "avent-rules": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "./rules"]
    }
  }
}
```
